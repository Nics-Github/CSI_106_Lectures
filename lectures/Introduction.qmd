## First Day

Welcome to CSI 106

We will be coding from scratch. I assume that you all have little to no background in programming.

## We have a bunch of todos.

Introduction

Talk to each other

AI policy

Sign up for Github

Get into Github Classroom

Talk to each other

Introduce you to Visual Studio Code via Code Spaces

Code something

## About me

My name is Nicholas Schwab.

I'm studying Data Science as grad student at UT Austin.

I used to be in the Math Department here and lectured Data Science at Smith.

I like Rock Climbing and biking and hanging with my family.

I live in Easthampton.

My first programming language was R. 

## Some Photos

## About You

Introduce yourself to your neighbors. 
Name and Pronoun
Town you live in.
Rose of the summer. 
Coding Background, first language?

## Why CSI 106

You'll learn to "think like a computer scientist"
You'll build programs that are super neat and fun
You'll develop the skills need for industry. 

## What is computer science?

What is Computer Science?

Think pair share with those people you talked to before. 

## What is CS? 

What is Computer Science?

*"Computer science is the structured study of and the design of solutions for problems that are solivable with a series of steps"* - Pablo Frank

## Why CS?

Learn to Plan:

1. Find which two people in the class share the most courses this semester. 
2. Find the average number of classes taken this semester. 
3. Sort students by number of classes taken. 

Discuss with your peers. 

## Why CS?

Computer Science Thinking is not only for computer scienctist. 

Computers in Medience 
Nature
Facial Recognition

## Why CS?

What is Programming?

Reminder: *"Computer science is the structured study of and the design of solutions for problems that are solivable with a series of steps"* - Pablo Frank

Think pair share with those people you talked to before. 

## Why CS

What is Programming?

*Programming is the translation of an algorithm into strutured and unambiguous steps that are readable by some agent. *

## HCC choices

1. Computer Science Option, A.S.
2. Information Technology Management Option, A.S.
3. Cyber Security & Digital Forensics Option, A.S. (certificate)
4. Data Science Option, A.S.

## What will we do?

We will build tic-tac-toe from first principles.

## How will we do it?

## Why Python

![Pyton Image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Python-logo-notext.svg/1024px-Python-logo-notext.svg.png)

Python is super popular right now.

Its a friendlier language, which is nice for beginners.

## Where is python used?

## AI policy

We will use [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JaUvGhvMC3y4exeBM40axUjVmFEJOPpxyq6Agzx8MrQ/edit?usp=sharing) to develop our AI policy. 

## Think Pair Share AI

I will now partner you up so you can share how you have used AI, and how you think you should use it in this class. 

We will come back and draft some AI policy which we will revisit at the end of class and throughout the semester. 


## But AI can do almost everything?

Yes, but you wont learn if you use AI.

Let's try it with [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/)

## Complicated things

-   A human is still needed for new or complicated projects.

-   You will still have to fix bugs in AI.

-   You will come across code that is complicated and read/edit it.

-   We will see how AI has trouble during the semester.

-   If you work in a niche field AI will not necessarily be there to help.

## Mid class break

-   This class is Long

-   We'll have a break midclass.

-   Stand up stretch, get some water, look at your phone

## Github Classroom

Click [this link](https://classroom.github.com/a/IWFFANCJ) for our first activity using github. 

## Repository Tour

Let's take a tour of github.

## Madlibs

[mad libs](https://svickars.github.io/mad-libs/)

## This code exists on github. 

[mas-libs repo](https://github.com/svickars/mad-libs)


## Can AI make Mad Libs?

Totally! Is it as good as Sam Vickers?

Can you open up some AI tool and make it? 

## Break
 

## Intoduction to VS Code

Brace Yourselves

## Let's do our first exercise! 

[Hello World](https://classroom.github.com/a/IWFFANCJ)

Live Coding. 

## Textbook

We have a lot of reading in this course. You need to do the reading to stay up to date. There will be very little lecture in this course. 

## Here are our to dos and reading

[homework week 1](https://canvas.hcc.edu/courses/15554/pages/to-do-and-reading-week-1?module_item_id=877545)

Let's start it together. 

If you can read chapters 1 and 2 before Thursday.
